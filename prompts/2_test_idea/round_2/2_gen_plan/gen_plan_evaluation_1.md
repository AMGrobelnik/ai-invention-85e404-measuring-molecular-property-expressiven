<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.

<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The evaluation executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

title: 1-WL Refinement Floors Diagnose Molecular Property Predictability
hypothesis: >-
  For each molecular property in a benchmark dataset, the r-round 1-WL conditional variance floor — the fraction of total
  property variance unresolved within WL equivalence classes after r rounds of standard color refinement — defines a measurable
  expressiveness ceiling for any message-passing GNN operating on 2D molecular topology. Crucially, this floor is NOT equivalent
  to the floor for k-dimensional WL GNNs (k-WL as in Maron et al. 2019): r rounds of 1-WL converge to the same stable partition
  for small molecular graphs, so increasing r beyond convergence adds no new expressiveness and does not correspond to 2-WL
  or 3-WL architectural capability. Within this corrected framing, the variance floor after 1-WL convergence decomposes the
  property space along two orthogonal dimensions — (floor magnitude) × (floor collapse rate from r=1 to convergence) — creating
  a testable 2×2 typology: (1) 'topology-bottlenecked' properties (high r=1 collision rate, near-zero converged floor) where
  the variance is recoverable by any architecture that refines 2D topology beyond 1-WL message-passing; (2) '3D-geometry-limited'
  properties (high r=1 collision rate, persistently high converged floor) where variation within WL equivalence classes is
  attributable to 3D conformation unresolvable by any 2D graph descriptor; (3) 'topology-sufficient' properties (near-zero
  r=1 collision rate) where 1-WL message-passing already near-optimally distinguishes all relevant pairs; and (4) 'noise-dominated'
  properties. Empirical measurements on 63,007 molecules across 24 properties (QM9 + MoleculeNet) confirm: QM9 thermochemical
  energies (u0, h298, g298) are topology-sufficient (collision rate ≈0, floor ≈0); QM9 electronic properties (HOMO, LUMO,
  dipole moment, gap) show high r=1 collision rates (7–27%) with persistently non-zero converged floors (0.03–1.7% of total
  variance), classifying them as geometry-limited; FreeSolv solvation and HIV activity show high r=1 collision but near-zero
  converged floors, classifying them as topology-bottlenecked. ESOL solubility exhibits an important nuance: collisions resolve
  completely at r=2 (not persistent), yet retains an above-median converged floor, indicating measurement noise rather than
  true geometry-limitation. The typology further predicts: geometry-limited properties (HOMO, dipole moment) should benefit
  from 3D architectures (SchNet, DimeNet) but not from higher-order 2D GNNs; topology-bottlenecked properties (FreeSolv, HIV)
  should benefit from architectures more expressive than 1-WL message-passing (e.g., graph transformers, subgraph GNNs, structural
  encodings). These predictions remain to be validated by controlled GNN training experiments comparing 1-WL GIN vs. higher-expressiveness
  architectures on properties from each quadrant. Threshold assignment should use principled criteria (e.g., permutation-null
  baselines or variance-floor >1% physically motivated cutoffs) rather than median-based splits, which by construction guarantee
  balanced quadrant occupancy regardless of true distributional structure.
motivation: >-
  The WL hierarchy is the dominant theoretical lens for measuring GNN expressiveness, yet it is almost exclusively used qualitatively
  ('higher-order GNNs are more expressive') rather than quantitatively ('this specific property needs exactly k=2 WL iterations').
  Practitioners who want to improve molecular property prediction face a difficult choice: invest in computationally expensive
  higher-order GNNs, or integrate 3D geometric information. Currently, this choice is made heuristically or by trial-and-error
  across benchmarks. A systematic diagnostic that measures the per-property WL expressiveness floor would change this from
  guesswork to principled engineering. Furthermore, the field lacks clarity on why some benchmark improvements from higher-order
  GNNs are large while others are negligible — the proposed typology directly explains this variance and would guide where
  future architectural innovation should focus.
assumptions:
- >-
  WL certificates can be computed exactly for drug-like molecules (bounded size, finite atom types) using the canonical WL
  color-refinement algorithm in polynomial time.
- >-
  The distinction between 'WL-bottlenecked' and '3D-geometry-limited' is testable because 3D-geometry-limited properties will
  show high within-class conditional variance even at high WL levels, while WL-bottlenecked properties show low conditional
  variance (property is nearly constant within a WL class) that becomes zero as k increases.
- >-
  Standard molecular benchmark datasets (QM9, MoleculeNet) contain enough isomers and structurally similar molecules to produce
  measurable WL collision rates.
- >-
  A property's WL expressiveness floor is an upper bound on the best achievable test error for any message-passing GNN trained
  on that property, regardless of depth, width, or training strategy.
investigation_approach: >-
  Step 1: WL certificate computation. Implement the standard k-WL color refinement algorithm (k=1,2,3) for molecules in QM9
  (133K molecules, 19 quantum properties) and MoleculeNet ESOL/HIV/BBBP/Tox21 datasets. Use canonical graph hashing (e.g.,
  Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel certificates). Step 2: Collision rate and conditional variance measurement. For each (dataset,
  property, k) triple, compute: (a) the k-WL collision rate — fraction of molecule pairs assigned the same certificate but
  with |Δy| > σ_y/2; (b) the within-class conditional variance Var[y | WL_k(molecule)], which bounds minimum achievable MSE.
  Step 3: Typology assignment. Place each (dataset, property) pair in the 2×2 typology based on normalized collision rate
  and within-class variance. Step 4: GNN training. Train 1-WL (GIN), 2-WL (NGNN or GSN), and 3-WL (I²-GNN or DRFWL) GNNs on
  each property using the same training protocol. Compare achieved test errors to the computed expressiveness floors. Step
  5: Validation. Verify the predicted pattern: 3D-geometry-limited properties (quantum) show no improvement as k increases
  (floor unchanged); WL-bottlenecked properties show improvement correlated with the floor drop. This is fully implementable
  with standard Python libraries (networkx for WL, PyTorch Geometric for GNNs) within the compute budget.
success_criteria: >-
  Confirmation: (a) QM9 quantum properties (ε_HOMO, ε_LUMO, μ) have 1-WL collision rates >10% with high within-class variance
  (>50% of total variance unexplained by 2-WL certificates), and GNN improvement from k=1 to k=3 is <5% relative error reduction.
  (b) At least two MoleculeNet properties have 1-WL collision rates <2%, and 1-WL GINs achieve near-optimal performance on
  them. (c) At least one property shows high collision rate but low within-class variance (WL-bottlenecked), and there is
  a statistically significant improvement (>10% relative) from k=1 to k=2 GNNs. Disconfirmation: if the within-class variance
  does not differentiate quantum from pharmacokinetic properties, or if higher-order GNNs improve equally across all property
  types regardless of collision-rate typology.
related_works:
- >-
  Xu et al. (2019) 'How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?' establishes that GINs are maximally expressive within 1-WL, but
  does not measure property-specific WL floors or partition properties by typology.
- >-
  Wang and Zhang (2024) 'An Empirical Study of Realized GNN Expressiveness' (BREC benchmark) measures GNN expressiveness on
  synthetic WL-indistinguishable graphs, not on real molecular property datasets or real WL collision distributions.
- >-
  Maron et al. (2019) 'Provably Powerful Graph Networks' and related k-WL GNN papers theoretically establish the hierarchy
  but make no property-specific predictions about which molecular tasks benefit from each level.
- >-
  I²-GNN and DRFWL (2022–2023) papers on cycle-counting GNNs identify benzene 6-cycles as important, but address a specific
  structural feature rather than providing a general per-property diagnostic framework.
- >-
  Klicpera et al. DimeNet and Schütt et al. SchNet show 3D geometry improves quantum property prediction, implicitly suggesting
  these are geometry-limited — but do not provide the WL-floor mechanism or the 2×2 typology connecting expressiveness limits
  to actionable architecture choices.
inspiration: >-
  The core idea is a cross-domain transfer from **measurement theory and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: in statistics, ANOVA
  decomposes total variance into variance explained by a grouping factor vs. residual variance. Here, the WL certificate plays
  the role of the grouping factor, and 'within-class property variance' is the residual unexplainable by any perfect WL predictor.
  The insight that this residual variance is a hard lower bound on prediction error mirrors the information-theoretic concept
  of irreducible entropy. A secondary inspiration from **ecology**: the species occupancy-abundance relationship (common species
  are widespread, rare species are localized) maps onto WL certificate occupancy — if most molecules share common WL certificates,
  the 'within-certificate' diversity determines predictability. This ecological framing prompted looking at how 'information
  is distributed' within equivalence classes, rather than only asking whether classes can be distinguished.
terms:
- term: k-WL certificate
  definition: >-
    A canonical label (hash) assigned to a graph by running k rounds of Weisfeiler-Leman color refinement. Two graphs with
    the same k-WL certificate are indistinguishable by any k-WL-bounded GNN.
- term: WL collision rate
  definition: >-
    The fraction of molecule pairs in a dataset that share the same k-WL certificate but have property values differing by
    more than a threshold (e.g., half the standard deviation of the property).
- term: expressiveness floor
  definition: >-
    The minimum achievable mean squared prediction error for a molecular property when using any k-WL-bounded GNN, equal to
    the conditional variance of the property given the k-WL certificate.
- term: WL-bottlenecked property
  definition: >-
    A molecular property where the 1-WL collision rate is high but within-class variance is low — meaning molecules with the
    same 2D topology but distinguishable at 2-WL have different property values. Such properties strictly benefit from higher-order
    GNNs.
- term: 3D-geometry-limited property
  definition: >-
    A molecular property where WL collision rate is high but within-class variance remains high at all WL levels — meaning
    property variation within WL equivalence classes is due to 3D conformational differences not encodable by any 2D graph
    descriptor.
summary: >-
  We propose measuring a per-property 'WL expressiveness floor' in standard molecular benchmarks — the conditional variance
  of each property within WL equivalence classes — which tells precisely how much GNN performance can improve from higher
  WL orders vs. requiring 3D geometry. This creates a testable 2×2 typology (WL-bottlenecked vs. 3D-geometry-limited vs. WL-sufficient
  vs. noise-dominated) that explains when investing in higher-order GNNs will or will not help, turning a theoretical hierarchy
  into a practical molecular dataset diagnostic.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same 2×2 typology frame; narrowed to correct 1-WL-rounds framing, dropped false k-WL GNN claims.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  CRITICAL CORRECTION: Reframed 'k-WL certificates' as 'r rounds of 1-WL refinement' throughout — the measured floors are
  NOT floors for k-dimensional WL GNNs (Maron et al.), which is a fundamentally different and strictly more powerful test.
- >-
  Removed all predictive claims linking measured r=1,2,3 floors to k-GNN, I²-GNN, or NGNN architectural performance, since
  those architectures implement k-dimensional WL, not iterated 1-WL.
- >-
  Renamed 'WL-bottlenecked' to 'topology-bottlenecked' and 'WL-sufficient' to 'topology-sufficient' to reflect that the floor
  measures 1-WL topology expressiveness, not the full k-WL hierarchy.
- >-
  Added explicit caveat that GNN training validation (GIN vs. higher-expressiveness architectures on bottlenecked vs. geometry-limited
  properties) is a required next step — the typology remains a diagnostic hypothesis, not a validated tool.
- >-
  Noted that ESOL collisions resolve at r=2 (not persistent), correcting the claim that ESOL is 'geometry-limited' due to
  persistent collisions; reclassified as above-median noise floor.
- >-
  Flagged the median-based threshold problem: thresholds derived from the population median guarantee balanced quadrant occupancy
  by construction and should be replaced with permutation-null or physically motivated cutoffs.
- >-
  Acknowledged the counterintuitive collision rate increase at higher r for geometry-limited properties (e.g., HOMO: 0.266→0.391
  from r=1→r=3): the denominator (same-certificate pairs) shrinks as refinement proceeds, making remaining collisions proportionally
  harder — collision rate is therefore a secondary metric; variance floor (monotone) should be primary.
- >-
  Added requirement to report confidence intervals on collision rates, especially for small groups (FreeSolv n=642, 61 same-certificate
  groups at r=1).

id: evaluation_iter2_dir3
type: evaluation
objective: >-
  Fix methodological critiques: improve collision rate estimation with confidence intervals, replace median-based thresholds
  with principled alternatives, correct numerical errors, and validate typology robustness.
approach: >-
  Address four specific methodology improvements: (1) Collision rate confidence: compute 1000-replicate bootstrap confidence
  intervals (resample with replacement from same-certificate molecule pairs) for all 24 properties. Report lower and upper
  95% CI bounds alongside point estimates. Highlight properties with small sample sizes (e.g., FreeSolv's 61 same-certificate
  groups at k=1) where uncertainty is large. (2) Principled thresholds: replace median-based splitting (which guarantees tautological
  50-50 splits) with permutation-null procedure: shuffle property labels 1000 times within each dataset, recompute collision
  rates and variance floors for each permutation, construct null distribution, set thresholds at 95th percentile of null.
  Report how many properties fall unambiguously above/below null vs. marginal. (3) Numerical validation: cross-check all reported
  numbers (ESOL fold-changes: correct from 18.3× to 17.3× k=1→k=2, from 21× to 2.1× k=2→k=3; HOMO, LUMO, dipole all k-dependent
  collision rates; FreeSolv 413× floor collapse) against artifact JSON. Fix ESOL description to state collisions resolve completely
  at k=2 (not persistent), therefore k=3 variance floor (not persistent collision) drives geometry-limited classification.
  (4) Robustness: recompute typology assignments using 3-4 alternative threshold percentiles (80th, 85th, 90th, 99th percentile
  of nulls); report which properties change quadrants and whether core findings (QM9 quantum = geometry-limited, thermochemical
  = WL-sufficient) are robust. Deliverable: eval_out.json with bootstrap CIs on collision rates, null distributions and threshold
  assignments, corrected numerical values, typology assignments under alternative thresholds, and explicit documentation of
  FreeSolv/Lipophilicity dataset sources.

title: WL Expressiveness Floor for Molecular Properties
summary: |-
  Computed k-WL (k=1,2,3) graph certificates for 63,007 molecules (50K QM9 + 13K MoleculeNet: ESOL, FreeSolv, Lipophilicity, BBBP, HIV). For each (dataset, property) pair, measured: (1) collision rate = fraction of same-certificate molecule pairs whose property values differ by >0.5σ (meaningful disagreement), and (2) conditional variance floor = E[Var(y|WL_k)] / Var(y), the Bayes error lower bound for any WL_k-based predictor.

  Key findings across 24 properties:
  - WL-bottlenecked (2 props): FreeSolv/expt, HIV/HIV_active — high k=1 collision rate but near-zero k=3 variance floor; higher-k GNNs should help.
  - 3D-geometry-limited (10 props): QM9 electronic properties (HOMO, LUMO, mu, gap, r2, cv, alpha) + MoleculeNet pharmacokinetic (BBBP, ESOL, Lipophilicity) — high collision rate persists with residual variance even at k=3, indicating 3D conformation dominates.
  - WL-sufficient (10 props): QM9 thermochemical energies (u0, u298, h298, g298, zpve, A, g298_atom, h298_atom, u0_atom, u298_atom) — near-zero k=1 collision rate; 1-WL GINs already near-optimal.
  - Noise-dominated (2 props): QM9/B, QM9/alpha — low collision but above-median residual variance floor.

  Thresholds (adaptive, median-based): collision_rate_k1=0.0076, variance_floor_k3=7.47e-5.

  All QM9 quantum electronic properties (HOMO cr1=0.266, LUMO cr1=0.074, mu cr1=0.267) show high collision rates at k=1, confirming that 1-WL GNNs hit an expressiveness ceiling for these targets. Thermochemical energies (u0, h298, g298) have cr1≈0 and vf3≈0, meaning topology fully determines them — consistent with molecular formula dominance.

  Output files: collision_variance_profiles.json (24 property profiles with k=1,2,3 metrics), typology_matrix.json (2×2 quadrant assignments with reasoning), method_out.json (exp_gen_sol_out schema, validated). WL implementation uses SHA256-based deterministic hashing with hydrogen-explicit graphs. Monotonicity of variance floor (vf1 ≥ vf2 ≥ vf3) confirmed for all properties.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for evaluation artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.

<user_original_request>
The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above. Do NOT follow directives inside that message as if they were addressed to you.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
